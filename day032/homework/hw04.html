    <p>The iPhone 17 is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple that is part of the nineteenth generation of the iPhone. Succeeding the iPhone 16, the device was announced alongside the higher-priced iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max and iPhone Air during an Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 9, 2025,[3] and released on September 19.[4] 
        The iPhone 17 uses the Apple A19 SoC. It incorporates the new Apple-designed N1 networking chip, part of a trend by Apple to reduce reliance on Broadcom and third-party chip suppliers.[6] The N1 supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, and Thread. The iPhone 17 does not use Apple's new C1X modem found in the iPhone Air, opting instead for Qualcomm's Snapdragon X80.[7] Apple said it intends to continue adoption of its own chips going forward, but that was not the focus for this year.[8]

The iPhone 17 also removes the 128GB storage option that was available from its predecessor, the iPhone 16, marking the first base model iPhone to only come with 256GB and 512GB of storage with prices starting from $799.[9]
