    <p>Jean Paul Gaultier[a] (French: [ʒɑ̃ pɔl ɡotje]; born 24 June 1952)[1] is a French haute couture and prêt-à-porter fashion designer.

He is described as an "enfant terrible" of the fashion industry and is known for his unconventional designs with motifs including corsets, marinières, and tin cans. Gaultier founded his eponymous fashion label in 1982, and expanded with a line of fragrances in 1993. He was the creative director for French luxury house Hermès from 2003 to 2010, and retired following his 50th-anniversary haute couture show during Paris Fashion Week in January 2020.[3]

As a costume designer, Gaultier created Madonna's cone bra for the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, and the costumes for the movies The City of Lost Children (1995), The Fifth Element (1997), Bad Education (2004) and The Skin I Live In (2011).[4]
Gaultier's first individual collection was released in 1976.[6] Although most people found his designs decadent at the time, fashion editors, notably Melka Tréanton of Elle, Claude Brouet and Catherine Lardeur of French Marie Claire, were impressed by his creativity and mastery of tailoring, and later launched his career.[8][9][10][11][12] In 1980, he designed women's dresses out of plastic rubbish bags.[13] Gaultier founded his eponymous fashion label in 1982.[14] His 1983 collection "Boy Toy" relaunched the marinière for men.[15] His garments were on sale at Bergdorf Goodman in New York as soon as 1984, and already lauded by Dawn Mello and Polly Allen Mellen. The term "Gaultiered" was coined to describe the classic pieces that were reinterpreted by the designer.[14] During the 1984 Fall London and Paris shows, Jean Paul Gaultier introduced his line of skirts for men (actually kilts), a breakthrough in men's fashion that stirred a bit of controversy.[16] In 1984, he also introduced the iconic women's corset with cone bra.[17] Gaultier has also worked in close collaboration with Wolford Hosiery.[18][19]

By 1985, his company made $50 million in sales worldwide.[20] For the premiere of the 1985 movie Desperately Seeking Susan, Madonna wore a skirt with men's suspenders she had bought from Gaultier.[7] Besides his ready-to-wear collection, in 1988 Gaultier expanded his brand to include the label Junior Gaultier, a lower-priced line of products.[21] The Junior Gaultier outfit was selected by Jeff Banks as the Dress of the Year.[22] In 1988, he also recorded the music video How to do that.[23] At the end of the 1980s he invented a new look for the French accordionist Yvette Horner which relaunched her career.[24] In 1989, he was tailoring a costume for Prince when the singer walked away, offended, thinking Gaultier had told him "fuck you" where the couturier with a heavy French accent had said "faux cul" (false bottom).[7] In 1990, he designed Madonna's clothes for her Blond Ambition World Tour.[21][25]

At the end of the 1980s, Gaultier suffered some personal losses, and in 1990 his boyfriend and business partner, Francis Menuge, died of AIDS-related causes.[26][21] It is also around that time that he decided to tone down his showmanship and started to plan more intimate events.[27]

Gaultier launched a line of fragrances (Classique) in 1993.[21] The Junior Gaultier label was replaced in 1994 with JPG by Gaultier, a unisex collection that followed the designer's idea of fluidity of the sexes. Gaultier Jean's, a similar line consisting mainly of denim and more simply styled garments with a heavy street influence, followed in 1992, which was then replaced with Jean's Paul Gaultier from 2004 to 2008. Junior Gaultier's name was reused in 2009 for the launching of the child's wear, to be completed with a Baby Line in 2011.

In 1998, Jean Paul Gaultier's company generated €12.9 million ($13.2 million) in sales. In 1999, Hermès acquired 35% of Gaultier's label for 150 million francs ($23 million). Jean Paul Gaultier owned 93% of his company prior to this deal.[28][29] In 2002, Gaultier's label opened its first fully-fledged stand-alone store.[30] Then, from 2003 to 2010, Gaultier was the creative director of Hermès[31] where he succeeded Martin Margiela.[32] Hermès later increased its stake in Jean Paul Gaultier to 45%.[31] By 2008, 40 Jean Paul Gaultier stores opened worldwide.[30]</p>
