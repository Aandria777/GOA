<p>The spaghetti Western is a broad subgenre of Western films produced in Europe. It emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's filmmaking style and international box-office success.[1] The term was used by foreign critics because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.[2]

The majority of the films in the spaghetti Western genre were international co-productions by Italy and Spain, and sometimes France, West Germany, Britain, Portugal, Greece, Yugoslavia, and the United States. Over six hundred European Westerns were made between 1960 and 1978,[3] including nearly five hundred in Italy, which dominated the market.[4] Most spaghetti Westerns filmed between 1964 and 1978 were made on low budgets, and shot at Cinecitt√† Studios and various locations around southern Italy and Spain.[5]</p>
